# NoteWise

Hey everyone! I’m excited to introduce my application, **NoteWise**—a platform where you can create, manage, and share notes in powerful ways. Let me walk you through it step by step.

## Dashboard

When you open the app, you’ll land on a beautiful dashboard that shows all the features NoteWise has to offer.

## Getting Started

To get started, you need to **sign up or log in**—my app is fully authenticated. Forgot your password? No problem, you can easily reset it. Once logged in, you’ll see your homepage. At first, it will be empty because you haven’t created any notes yet.

## Creating a Note

Here’s how you create a note:

1. Click on **New Note**.
2. Fill in the **title**, **content**, optional **mood**, and **tags**.
3. Enhance your title and content using **AI**—get summaries, tag suggestions, and more.
4. Click **Create**, and your note is saved.

## Other Features

- Edit notes anytime.
- Archive/Unarchive notes.
- Update your profile.
- Make notes public so others can read them.

## Smart Notes

One of the coolest features is **Smart Notes**. Verified users can access this—just click on **Smart Note** in the navbar. You can either:

- **Get Suggestions**: Enter a topic, and AI generates a title, summary, and tags.
- **Quick Create**: Enter a topic, and a note is instantly created.

You can also interact with AI directly for any note—improve content, add insights, or make it public for everyone to read.

**NoteWise** is your one-stop app for smarter, organized, and shareable notes.
